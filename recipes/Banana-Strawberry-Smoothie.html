    <li>>Gather Your Ingredients:**
        <p>- Make sure you have all the ingredients ready on your countertop.</p></li>
     
     <li>**Prep Your Banana:**
        <p>- Peel the ripe banana(and or frozen) and break it into a few chunks. This will make it easier to blend.</li>
     
     <li>Blend:
        <p>- Start blending on low speed and gradually increase to high speed.
             Blend until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is smooth.</p></li>
     
     <li>Check Consistency:
        <p>- If the smoothie is too thick for your liking,
             you can add a little more milk or water and blend again until you reach the desired consistency.</p></li>
     
    <li>Taste and Adjust:
        <p>- Taste the smoothie and adjust the sweetness by adding more honey or maple syrup if needed.</p></li>
     
     <li>Add Ice (Optional):
        <p>- If you want your smoothie colder and thicker, you can add ice cubes to the blender and blend again until the ice is completely crushed.</p></li>
     
    <li>Pour and Serve</li>
        <p>- Once you're satisfied with the consistency and taste, pour the smoothie into glasses.</p></li>
     
    <li>Garnish (Optional):</li>
        <p>- You can garnish your smoothie with a sprinkle of chia seeds, granola, a few fresh berries, or a mint leaf.</p>
