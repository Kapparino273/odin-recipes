    <li><p>Prepare the Ingredients:
    Chop the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic.
    If using ground beef, break it into small pieces.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cook the Pasta:
    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
    Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
    Drain the pasta and set aside.</p></li>
    <li><p>Sauté the Aromatics:
    In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and the onion is translucent.</p></li>
    <li><p>Brown the Meat:
    If using ground beef or turkey, add it to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables.
    Break up the meat using a spatula and cook until it's no longer pink and has browned.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add Tomatoes and Seasoning:
    Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper.
    If using red wine, add it at this point. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Simmer the Sauce:
    Pour in the beef or vegetable broth and stir to combine.
    Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet or saucepan, and let the sauce simmer for about 20-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cook the Pasta:
    While the sauce is simmering, you can reheat the cooked pasta by briefly placing it in a pot of boiling water. Drain well.</p></li>
    <li><p>Serve:
    To serve, place a portion of cooked spaghetti on each plate.
    Spoon the Bolognese sauce over the pasta.
    Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enjoy:
    Serve the Spaghetti Bolognese hot and enjoy a hearty and flavorful dinner!</p></li>
